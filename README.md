## Manager

The manager has four options:
* View Products for Sale

* Add to Inventory
* Add New Product

Choose one by typing the number that represents each product

### View Products for Sale

This option will print all of the products that are for sale.

### View Low Inventory

This option will print all of the products that have less than 5 items in stock. 

### Add to Inventory

This option will increase the quantity of the specified product.

The inputs are the ID of the product that is getting more items and the number of items being added.
Both should be integer values.

### Add New Product

This option will add a new product to the database.

The inputs are the product's name, the department it is located in, the price, and the quantity.
The product and department names should be strings and the price and quantity should be integers (*no decimals* for now).
